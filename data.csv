If it's a site, then I'm wondering about its purpose and also about security; these records are protected by law (I think it's HIPAA but I could be wrong about that). Is this an effort to put everything in one place, because of how fractured the US health care ""system"" is? I guess I just don't understand enough about it to feel comfortable using it.

Common Health I know only from what you've said here, which isn't enough to comment on the costs and benefits. Patient portals *on a website* (rather than an app) can also vary widely. I suppose these things might be good for people who don't keep their own records *but* - can they understand medical jargon? I'm a former RN, I know how these records are written because I've written some, and I doubt most ""civilians"" will be able to make sense of them - which means they'll go online looking for explanations, which can be dangerous (because of all the misinformation). They could be changed so that they can be understood by someone with no health care training but that takes time that most providers don't have (and no AI can handle), and it has the potential to make those records much less precise and clear for other health care practitioners.
