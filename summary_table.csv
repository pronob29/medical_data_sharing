It's a huge benefit because my health information is all in one place and the cost I can attribute to being a perk of my health insurance. It helps me to see all of the information in one place in an easy to read format. As far as apple health records or CommonHealth, I don't think they charge for access. With apple health, you are required to have apple products. I see the benefits of these to be similar because they're all different methods of tracking your health, so they all have value in my opinion. The third-party apps seem like a risk with sending your health information because there is no benefit to you, only to general society. It's a risk that seems unnecessary to take.

Common Health I know only from what you've said here, which isn't enough to comment on the costs and benefits. Patient portals *on a website* (rather than an app) can also vary widely. I suppose these things might be good for people who don't keep their own records *but* - can they understand medical jargon? I'm a former RN, I know how these records are written because I've written some, and I doubt most ""civilians"" will be able to make sense of them - which means they'll go online looking for explanations, which can be dangerous (because of all the misinformation). They could be changed so that they can be understood by someone with no health care training but that takes time that most providers don't have (and no AI can handle), and it has the potential to make those records much less precise and clear for other health care practitioners.

323,The cost other than perhaps a subscription charge are cost to privacy.  I do not trust the apps or the entities they share information with.  The benefits may be in more complete care plans that are synched but I am not sold yet.,cost,0.4192,positive
324,"These technologies allow one to tabulate and better access medicals records, prescriptions and other essential data related to one's health.

330,"The main cost to me is that of a loss of privacy. I do not know what privacy rights and uses are associated with Apple Health Records and who could see my data if it were intercepted or hacked somehow. I suppose the main benefit for some of these technologies is that the information could be used (aggregated, responsibly) to develop new treatments via public health research (assuming it had the appropriate IRB protections).",cost,-0.25,negative
331,I am not sure what the costs would be if we are talking in terms of monthly subscriptions for third-party apps.  The benefits would be that I would not have to worry about finding my paper copies of medical reports and I would not have to carry large x-rays and scans to doctor appointments.  The benefits would be that the person taking care of me would have the necessary records in one place.  That all my doctors would have access immediately without waiting for one doctor's office to send the records to another doctor's office.  The benefit would be if I had a medical emergency my records could be accessed immediately and could save my life. ,cost,0.9089,positive
332,Cost is giving up private data and the benefits are getting better health with more data. The more data you have usually the better the results.,benefits,0.8689,positive
334,"I think the patient portal is great. I have used my husband‚Äôs to give other providers information such as dates of visits, or prescriptions. I think the Apple Health Records would have the same benefits. Third-party apps still not sure about.
I would assume there would be no costs.",cost,0.5481,positive
335,"The healthcare organization's patient portal is the one I'm most comfortable with since it's direct connection with my healthcare provider. I'm also comfortable with a trusted app that has the same information like CommonHealth. They can be used to keep track of important information that I need to be aware of. I don't think third-party apps need most of that information, but they could be useful to keep track of things like weight loss or when I need to take medications. I wouldn't be comfortable telling them my specific medications, though. I don't know enough about third-party apps for societal benefit so I would be hesitant to comment on them.",trust,0.958,positive
336,"I think the benefit of patient portals is convenience for one, like having the ability to message my doctor with questions or prescription refills and being able to look at my health records, test results, etc. I think apps like Apple Health are great for keeping track of health issues, but I don't feel comfortable using apps on my phone that keep that kind of personal data on my device. Because portals are accessed through the internet and are constantly monitored for data breaches and other security, I feel they are safer to use.  ",access,0.8734,positive
337,I think management of health will be more convenient and thorough. I feel costs will be minimal. My patient portal is free and Apple subscriptions are the most reasonably priced in the business.,cost,0.5106,positive

I think it is a good thing that patient's healthcare is always available to them and that they should always be empowered with information to make the proper decisions for themselves.

353,Patient portal allows quick access to rudimentary personal health information.  I see no benefit to apps that store personal health information.,access,0.2023,positive

Costs:  As it is now, by different providers don't have access to all my medical information.

379,Patient portal has little cost and allows for greater doctor-patient communication. Apple Health Records also for better centralization of this data but it is out of the hands of just your doctor.

394,"I see them all as negatives because they are apps for mobile phones rather than data that can be securely accessed on a desktop.  The only possible benefit that I can see from them is if you are going to a new provider and want to pull up test records that you either forgot to bring or didn't realize the new provider would want to see.  I think it is best though to keep this type of data only available via a secure desktop connection on a computer with strong protection and have two factor authentication on the account. Then if you need the records for a new provider (which you shouldn't as your original doctor should be able to send the data over electronically), you can just print it out.  This applies to all of the types listed - they should be computer access only.",access,0.9317,positive
395,I see a lot of benefits of a common health portal. All your records can be accessed in one location. It makes it very easy as a patient to get access in one place. I also presume the costs could be low for such an app and hence benefits a lot.,cost,0.7425,positive
