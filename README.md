# medical_data_sharing

This repository contains a collection of medical data sharing resources. The data was collected from the qualtrics. 
Here, we used the sentiment analysis and bivariate analysis to analyze the data. Also, we did a multiple linear regression with response variable as the techScore. 

We used python and R to do the analysis. Our final goal of this project is to find whether the participants are satisfied with the data sharing platform or not.
This is a Human Computer Interaction project. From our analysis we draw the conclusion that the participants are satisfied with the data sharing only to conventional institution but still not with third party apps.
